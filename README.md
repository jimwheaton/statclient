# Statclient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1. You will need to download this first. It was written in Typescript (the language Angular 2 uses). I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to review the project as it understands Typescript.

## Development server

Once you install Angular CLI, run `ng serve --prod` to point the app at the api running on Azure. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
